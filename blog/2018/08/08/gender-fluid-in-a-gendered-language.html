        Gender fluid in a gendered language
      </h2>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I changed the default English pronoun I use to <code class="highlighter-rouge">they</code> some time ago. For a long time I thought it 
impossible to incorporate a similar approach in my native language, until I realized I’ve been doing 
it all along.</p>

<p>Polish is a gendered language. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Table</code> is male, <code class="highlighter-rouge">floor</code> is female, while <code class="highlighter-rouge">chair</code> is of a third gender, 
similar to English <code class="highlighter-rouge">it</code>. I’m not sure there  is logic behind these assignments, but the fact is it’s 
very hard to speak Polish without a gender in mind. Every noun, pronoun, verb and adjective have a gender 
and there is no agreed on way of being gender neutral, without using <code class="highlighter-rouge">it</code> that is somewhat dismissive or 
derogatory (at least when used for adults).</p>

<p>Yet I have been gender fluid in Polish all my life without fully realizing it. My first name, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alicja</code>, I use 
with female grammar forms. My second name, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Karolina</code>, I usually abbreviate to the male <code class="highlighter-rouge">Karol</code>, and use it with 
male forms. It’s seamless for my loved ones, as they use both (though they usually have a preference, 
with my mom using my first name and my grandparents using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Karol</code> exclusively, unless they’re mad at me).</p>

<p>Thinking back, it’s suprising how easy it has been to use both my names without focusing on gender. 
If anyone had an issue with it, I’d just refer to it as a “personal choice” or a “family tradition”.</p>
