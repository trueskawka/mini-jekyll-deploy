        Browsing in grayscale
      </h2>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I started exploring my browsing habits to better understand why certain websites grab my attention.
As aware of UX dark patterns as I am, I grew tired of mindfully noticing when they want to “nudge” 
me into certain behaviors with vibrant colors and obscuring others by making them less visually
appealing.</p>

<p>While I was trying to unsubscribe from yet another unwanted email marketing list, chasing for the 
“unsubscribe” link hidden in plain sight, I noticed that grayscale works well for techincally showing the 
information required of advertisers, yet obscuring it among the flashy colorful action calls.</p>

<p>My previous attempt at decreasing the time I spend on social media was leveraging <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a>
to hide certain parts of websites, e.g. related videos and comments on YouTube. It manages user styles, 
with a simple checkbox menu for enabling and disabling them.</p>

<p>Since I use FireFox, switching to grayscale is fairly simple. I created a new stylesheet that applies to 
all websites and added a single property for <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code>. (you can also add a filter in <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/330830/how-to-turn-web-pages-in-browser-into-black-white-grayscale">other browsers</a>)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>body {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easy to turn it off when I want to. And it encouraged me to fix minor annoyances on some websites. 
I stopped using AdBlock when I switched to FireFox and I now use targeted <code class="highlighter-rouge">display: none</code> on elements 
I find distracting.</p>

<p>A minor caveat of the extension is that it doesn’t work on all websites, because it’s a WebExtension. 
I found that it only makes me appreciate it more when I encouter a page that doesn’t apply my user 
styles.</p>

<p>One more surprising issue I encountered is that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">grayscale</code> filter sometimes breaks scrolling. I tried 
debugging it on my website, thinking it might be caused by some legacy code or a hidden Stylus property, 
but adding it directly to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code> also changed scrolling behavior.</p>
